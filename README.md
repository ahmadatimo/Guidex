## 3. Description

### Our Motivation
Our motivation is to give the best experience to students visiting Bilkent, which starts with the application process. We want this experience to attract the brightest minds and show them the greatness of our university.

### Our Goals
We aim to make the application process as smooth and satisfying as possible, allowing schools and students to apply for an appointment to visit Bilkent and be informed about us with ease. Furthermore, we aim to give our communications department a flawless stream of data and ease their job of managing appointments to achieve the highest quality and professionalism possible. 


### Problems our project aims to address
There are two main problems the web app will address, the unorganized appointment-making process and poor quality data captured from school and students. The web app will help sort out the appointment-making process to be clearer, more manageable, and more professional, creating an attractive introduction to our university. Furthermore, the web app will provide the communications department with clearer and more usable data that will allow them to target students and schools better and increase the number of high-performing students coming to Bilkent from all around the country.
