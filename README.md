### Our Goals

### Problems our project aims to address

### Features

Our project is designed with two distinct user roles: **Visitors** (such as high school counselors, students, etc.) and **Bilkent Staff**. Each user type has access to specific features that cater to their needs.

We will implement a robust authentication system using email and password login, ensuring a secure experience for all users. Below is a breakdown of the key features for both user groups:

---

#### Visitor Features (High School Counselors, Students, etc.)

Visitors will have access to the following core functionalities:

- **Appointment Management**:  
  Visitors can view both their past and upcoming appointments in an intuitive **calendar format**, making it easy to track and manage their schedules.
- **Create an Appointment**:  
  Easily schedule a tour or meeting with Bilkent staff through a streamlined booking process.

- **About Bilkent**:  
  A dedicated section where visitors can learn more about Bilkent University, its programs, and campus life. This will serve as a resource to improve engagement and understanding of what the university offers.

- **Settings**:  
  Basic account management options, where users can view and update their personal information, such as email, password, and preferences.

- **Feedback**:  
  After completing a tour or appointment, visitors will be prompted to leave feedback about their experience. This feature aims to gather insights to improve the campus tours and visitor experience.

#### Admin Features (Bilkent Staff)

Bilkent staff, such as administrators and tour guides, will have access to a comprehensive **dashboard** to manage appointments, review visitor data, and track feedback.

- **Requests Management**:  
  Admins can view and manage tour or appointment requests, with options to **accept** or **cancel** pending appointments.

- **Data Visualization**:  
  Insightful charts and graphs displaying key statistics, such as the number of students from different high schools. This will help Bilkent staff make data-driven decisions and understand visitor demographics.

- **Visitor Feedback**:  
  Bilkent staff and guides can access feedback left by visitors, enabling them to address any concerns or improve the overall visitor experience.

---

These features will ensure a seamless experience for both visitors and Bilkent staff, enhancing communication, efficiency, and overall satisfaction.
