1. Performance Requirements
Response Time: The system shall ensure that appointment creation and data retrieval actions have a response time of no more than 2 seconds under typical load conditions (up to 1000 users per day).
Scalability: The system must handle at least a 50% increase in user traffic during peak application periods without performance degradation.
Availability: The system shall be available 99.9% of the time during business hours (08:00 - 18:00) to ensure students and staff can access it consistently.
2. Security Requirements
Data Protection: The system shall ensure that all user data, including personal information and feedback, is encrypted both at rest and in transit using AES-256 encryption.
Authentication: The system will implement robust user authentication mechanisms using email/password login and multi-factor authentication for admin users.
Access Control: Only authorized Bilkent staff should have access to administrative functions like managing appointments, viewing sensitive visitor data, and data visualization.
Privacy: The system shall comply with Turkish data protection laws, ensuring no personal information (beyond necessary contact and identification details) is disclosed without user consent.
3. Usability Requirements
Ease of Use: The user interface shall be intuitive, with a clear navigation structure, allowing users to schedule appointments and view information within 3 clicks.
Support and Help: Help documentation and FAQs shall be accessible from every page of the user dashboard to reduce training time and aid in onboarding new users.
Accessibility: The system shall conform to WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.
4. Reliability Requirements
Uptime: The system shall ensure an uptime of at least 99.9% during peak usage times and a recovery time of no more than 5 minutes in the event of a failure.
Error Handling: The system should automatically log any errors that occur and attempt to recover within 2 seconds, with appropriate error messages displayed to users.
5. Portability and Compatibility Requirements
Browser Compatibility: The system must be compatible with the latest versions of popular web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Device Support: The system should be responsive and functional on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.
6. Maintainability Requirements
Modular Design: The codebase should follow a modular structure to ensure easy updates and modifications as the system evolves over time.
Documentation: Full documentation for all system components shall be provided, including API documentation for future integration with other university systems.
7. Scalability
Capacity: The system must support up to 10,000 user accounts and be able to handle up to 500 concurrent users without a significant drop in performance.
Load Balancing: The system architecture shall include load balancing mechanisms to distribute traffic and avoid single points of failure during high-demand periods.
