### Layered Architecture Overview  
Layered architecture structures an application into distinct layers, each handling a specific responsibility. Layers interact only with adjacent ones, promoting separation of concerns, modularity, and ease of maintenance.  
**Typical Layers:**  
1. **Presentation Layer**: Manages user interactions and displays data.  
   - Tools: React/Next.js.  
   - Purpose: Provides interfaces for students, counselors, and staff to manage tours, appointments, and feedback.  
2. **Application Layer**: Implements business logic.  
   - Tools: FastAPI (Python).  
   - Purpose: Handles authentication, appointment scheduling, and feedback analysis.  
3. **Data Access Layer**: Interacts with databases or external data.  
   - Tools: Supabase/PostgreSQL.  
   - Purpose: Manages data storage for users, appointments, and feedback.  
4. **Database Layer**: Stores and indexes all system data.

### Benefits  
1. **Modularity**: Separation of concerns simplifies maintenance and understanding.  
2. **Scalability**: Allows scaling individual components without affecting others, e.g., adding mobile support without backend changes.  
3. **Maintainability**: Updates in one layer don’t cascade into others.  
4. **Testability**: Each layer is independently testable.  
5. **Reusability**: Business rules can be reused across interfaces (web, mobile).  
6. **Alignment with Project Needs**:  
   - Supports distinct UI flows for students, counselors, and staff.  
   - Handles multi-level authentication and feedback processing effectively.

### Comparison to Alternatives  
1. **Microservices**: Too complex for this small-scale project.  
2. **Event-Driven**: Less suitable due to the need for synchronous workflows.  
3. **Monolithic**: Easier to start but lacks scalability and maintainability for future needs.

### Conclusion  
Layered architecture offers a balance of simplicity, scalability, and maintainability, fitting the project’s requirements. It ensures a robust, modular system that can evolve, supporting future enhancements like mobile apps or advanced analytics.
