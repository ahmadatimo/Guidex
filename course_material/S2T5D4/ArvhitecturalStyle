Layered Architecture 
Layered architecture structures the system into distinct layers, ensuring separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability. Each layer interacts only with its adjacent layers, offering a streamlined and scalable design.  
Typical Layers:  
1. Presentation Layer:  
   - Tools: React + Vite  
   - Purpose: Provides interfaces for end users (students, counselors, and staff) to interact with the system. Focuses on intuitive UI/UX for managing tours, appointments, and feedback.  
2. Application Layer:  
   - Tools: Python (FastAPI)  
   - Purpose: Implements core business logic, such as authentication, appointment management, and feedback analysis. Serves as the bridge between the frontend and backend.  
3. Data Access Layer:  
   - Tools: SQLAlchemy (for MySQL)  
   - Purpose: Abstracts database interactions, allowing for clean and maintainable queries. Manages user, appointment, and feedback data storage and retrieval.  
4. Database Layer:  
   - Tools: MySQL  
   - Purpose: Physically stores and indexes system data, ensuring reliability and optimized querying.

 Benefits  
1. Modularity:  
   - Clear division of responsibilities simplifies debugging, updates, and collaboration.  
2. Scalability:  
   - Easily extendable for new features, e.g., adding analytics or mobile interfaces.  
3. Maintainability:  
   - Updates to one layer (e.g., backend logic) do not require changes in others.  
4. Testability:  
   - Enables independent testing of UI, logic, and data components.  
5. Reusability:  
   - Backend logic and database models can be reused across different frontend interfaces or platforms.  
6. Alignment with Project Needs:  
   - Supports the structured workflows of multi-role users (students, counselors, and staff).  
   - Effectively handles complex requirements like authentication and feedback management.

 Comparison to Alternatives  
1. Microservices:  
   - Overkill for the current scope and team size. Layered architecture is simpler to implement and manage.  
2. Event-Driven:  
   - Not suitable as synchronous workflows dominate project requirements.  
3. Monolithic:  
   - While simpler to start, it lacks the scalability and flexibility required for potential future growth, such as incorporating mobile apps or additional services.

 Conclusion  
The chosen layered architecture, updated with React + Vite, Python (FastAPI), and MySQL with SQLAlchemy, offers a balanced approach. It provides a clean, scalable, and maintainable structure that fits the projectâ€™s requirements while being flexible enough to adapt to future enhancements. This architecture ensures a robust system that aligns with current development tools and methodologies.
