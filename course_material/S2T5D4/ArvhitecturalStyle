 3-Tier Architecture  
The system follows a Client-Server architectural style with a 3-tier model. This structure ensures separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability by dividing responsibilities across three layers: Client (frontend), Application Logic (backend), and Data Access (database). Each layer has distinct roles and communicates with adjacent layers, providing a scalable and efficient design.  
 Typical Layers  
1. Client (Frontend):  
   - Tools: React + Vite  
   - Purpose: Provides an intuitive interface for end users (students, counselors, and staff) to interact with the system. Focuses on intuitive UI/UX for managing tours, appointments, and feedback.  
2. Application Logic (Backend):  
   - Tools: Python (FastAPI)  
   - Purpose: Handles core business logic, such as authentication, appointment scheduling, and feedback processing. Acts as the intermediary between the client and database layers. 
3. Data Access (Database):  
   - Tools: MySQL with SQLAlchemy ORM  
   - Purpose: Manages the storage and retrieval of system data, including users, appointments, and feedback. Abstracts low-level database interactions to ensure maintainability and performance.

 Benefits of 3-Tier Architecture  
1. Modularity:  
   - Clear separation of responsibilities across tiers simplifies debugging, updates, and collaboration.  
2. Scalability:  
   - Allows easy extension for new features, e.g., adding a mobile client or analytics dashboards.  
3. Maintainability:  
   - Changes to one tier, such as the backend logic, do not directly impact other tiers.  
4. Testability:  
   - Enables independent testing of UI components, business logic, and database queries.  
5. Reusability:  
   - Backend services and database models can be reused across different client interfaces (e.g., mobile apps or web).  
6. Alignment with Project Needs:  
   - Effectively supports multi-role workflows for students, counselors, and staff.  
   - Simplifies handling of complex requirements like authentication and feedback.

 Comparison to Alternatives  
1. Microservices:  
   - Overkill for the current project scope and team size. The 3-tier model is simpler to implement and manage.  
2. Event-Driven:  
   - Unsuitable for this project as synchronous workflows dominate, such as booking appointments and immediate feedback submission.  
3. Monolithic:  
   - While easier to start, it lacks the modularity and scalability offered by the 3-tier architecture, especially for potential growth like integrating a mobile client or adding advanced analytics.  
 Conclusion  
The chosen 3-tier architecture—with React + Vite for the client, Python (FastAPI) for application logic, and MySQL with SQLAlchemy for data access—offers a robust and flexible structure. It aligns with project needs and ensures scalability, maintainability, and testability. This architecture is well-suited to the current development team and project scope while being adaptable to future enhancements.
